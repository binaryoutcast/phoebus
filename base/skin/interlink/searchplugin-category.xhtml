<h1>{$PAGE_TITLE}</h1>

<p>A search plugin provides the ability to access a search engine from a web browser, without having to go to the engine's website first. Technically, a search plugin is a small xml file that tells the default browser what information to send to a search engine and how the results are to be retrieved.</p>

<div class="category-other">
  {foreach $PAGE_DATA as $key}
    <a href="/?component=download&id={$key.id}" name="#{$key.slug}" class="fake-table-row-search-plugin">
      <img src="{$key.icon}" class="alignleft" width="16px" height="16px" />
      <div style="margin-top: 0px;">
        <strong>{$key.name}</strong>
      </div>
    </a>

<p>The following search plugins are already included by default thus cannot be listed here as they would conflict: <strong>DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, and Wikipedia</strong>.</p>
